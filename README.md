# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 
For this project, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. the goal is to work through statistical conclusions to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


# Datasets used
> ab_data.csv

> countries.csv

# Content
Introduction

Part I - Probability

Part II - A/B Test

Part III - Regression

# Conclusion:
In the end of this analysis and after I preform the A/B Test I conclude that I fail to reject the null hypothesis beacuse there is no sufficient evidence to assume that the new page is better than the old page. So, I suggest to keep the old page.
